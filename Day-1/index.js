// nvm -- Node Version Manager  It is a version manager for Node.js, allowing you to easily switch between different versions of Node.js.
// yarn -- Yet Another Resource Negotiator proxy of npm with extra feature
// pnpm -- The pnpm is a fast disk space-efficient package manager for JavaScript projects. It optimizes the installation process by using a unique approach to the dependency management. Instead of creating a separate copy of each package for every project pnpm stores all packages in the global content-addressable store creating symlinks in the project directory. This reduces redundancy and speeds up installations.


// In summary, NPM is the default package manager for Node.js, NPX allows you to run packages without installing them globally, NVM allows you to manage different versions of Node.js, and YARN is an alternative package manager with additional features.
